# Absolute and relative errors

An approximation is any value that is similar but not equal to something else.

Approximations may be made for many reasons. These include:

1. Rounding
2. Simplifications made in the modelling of a problem
3. Calculations using approximations of irrational numbers

Approximations are often used when the exact value is too difficult to be worth finding or when a computer can only store a finite number of decimal places.

An example of an approximation is the value 3.14 being used as an approximation of $\pi$.

$$\begin{array}{c}
\text{let } X = \text{approximation} \\\\
\text{let } x = \text{exact value} \\\\
\text{absolute error} = X - x \\\\
\text{relative error} = \frac{X - x}{x} \text{ (if }x \neq 0)
\end{array}$$

Absolute errors show the difference between an approximation and its exact value while relative errors take into account the ratio of the error to the exact value.

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Exact value, } x & \text{Approximation, } X & \text{Absolute error, } X - x & \text{Relative error, (6 d.p.) } \frac{X - x}{x}\\ \hline
5.43 & 5.4 & -0.03 & -0.005525 \\ \hline
1642 & 2000 & 358 & 0.218027 \\ \hline
0.05 & 0.1 & 0.05 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$
