# Numerically Solving Equations

This is a website about numerical methods and numerical methods for solving equations.

This website teaches the numerical methods bisection method and false position. It also has calculators for solving equations numerically.

In the future, pages about fixed point iteration, Newton-Raphson method and Secant method will be added.

Numerical methods are useful for solving equations when it is difficult or impossible to symbolically solve an equation. The solutions from these methods are usually not exact but are good approximations.

This website makes use of mathematical typesetting to show expressions like below:

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

This website also makes use of spreadsheets as well as interactive examples that demonstrate visually the processes of numerical methods.
