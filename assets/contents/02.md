# Rounding and chopping

Values can be rounded to a certain accuracy to create approximations.

When a value has been rounded, the approximation will be shown with the number of decimal places or significant figures in brackets to show it is an approximation and its accuracy.

By giving the number of decimal places of significant figures, you can work out the range of possible values for the exact value. For example,

$$\begin{array}{c}
x = 0.2 \text{ (to 1 d.p.)} \\\\
0.15 \leq x < 0.25
\end{array}$$

When performing calculations with rounded approximations, round the results to a suitable degree of accuracy. Results usually should not be more accurate than the values used to find them.

Chopping is another method of approximation where digits beyond a given number of decimal places are dropped.

$$\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
x & x \text{ chopped to 1 d.p.} \\ \hline
8.76 & 8.7 \\ \hline
9.999 & 9.9 \\ \hline
1.01 & 1.0 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$

When many approximations are lost, there is often a cumulative effect to accuracy.

1000 random values with 1 decimal place are rounded to integers. The maximum increase and decrease in the approximations' values will be 0.5. If an equal number of approximations increase and decrease then the average absolute error will be 0. This will make the average absolute error in the total about 0.

1000 random values with 1 decimal place are rounded to integers. The maximum decrease in the approximations' values will be 0.9. This means that the average absolute error will be -0.45.

$$-0.45 = -\frac{0.9}{2}$$

The absolute error in the total will therefore be:

$$1000 \times -0.45 = -450$$
