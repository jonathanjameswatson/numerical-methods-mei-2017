title: Roots of equations
order: 4

The roots of an equation are the values of x where the equation is true.

$$\text{The roots of } x^2 = 4 \text{ are } x = 2 \text{ and } x = -2\text{.}$$

The roots of a function are where $y = 0$ or $f(x) = 0$.

You can see if a root is between two values by looking for a change of sign in the y value.

In the example below, 0.5 is proven to be a root.

$$f(x) = (x-0.5)(x-i)(x+i)$$

$$\text{Prove that }x = 0.5 \text{ (to 2 d.p.) is a root of f(x).}$$

$$0.45 \leq x < 0.55$$

$$f(0.45) = -0.060125$$

$$f(0.55) = 0.065125$$

$$y = 0$$

$$-0.060125 \leq y < 0.065125$$
